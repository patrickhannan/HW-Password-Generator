Next, the user will receive a series of 4 confirmation alerts asking the user to confirm whether they want a certain type of character. For example, the user will be prompted "Would you like your password to include lowercase letters?" and the user can either confirm that the password will contain this type, or they can cancel the usage of this type in the password generator.
